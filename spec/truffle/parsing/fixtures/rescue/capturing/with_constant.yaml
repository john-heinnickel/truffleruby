description: "capturing / with a constant"
yarp_specific: true
notes: >
  A constant capturing is represented with the following simplified AST:
  
    (WriteConstantNode name = ERROR
      (ObjectLiteralNode object =  :: Object)
      (ReadGlobalVariableNodeGen name = $!
        (LookupGlobalVariableStorageNodeGen name = $!)))
  
  that is equivalent to:
  
  ```ruby
  ERROR = $!
  ```

  begin
    "foo"
  rescue RuntimeError => ERROR
