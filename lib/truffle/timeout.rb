# = Description
#
# A way of performing a potentially long-running operation in a thread, and
# terminating it's execution if it hasn't finished within fixed amount of
# time.
#
# Previous versions of timeout didn't use a module for namespace. This version
# provides both Timeout.timeout, and a backwards-compatible #timeout.
#
# = Synopsis
#
#   require 'timeout'
#   status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
#     # Something that should be interrupted if it takes too much time...
#   }
#
