/** Some Ruby methods need access to the caller frame (the frame active when the method call was made) or to the storage
 * of special variables within that frame: see usages of {@link AlwaysInlinedMethodNode} and
 * {@link ReadCallerVariablesNode}. This is notably used to get hold of instances of {@link DeclarationContext} and
 * {@link RubyBinding} and methods which need to access the last regexp MatchData or the last IO line.
 *
 * <p>
 * This means that when making a method call, we might need to pass down its {@link Frame} or
 * {@link SpecialVariableStorage} active when the method call was made.
 *
 * <p>
 * Materializing a frame is expensive, and the point of this parent node is to only materialize the frame when we know
 * for sure it has been requested by the callee. It is also possible to walk the stack to retrieve the frame to
 * materialize - but this is even slower and causes a deoptimization in the callee every time we walk the stack.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class works in tandem with {@link FrameOrVariablesReadingNode} for this purpose. At first, we don't send down
 * the frame. If the callee needs it, it will de-optimize and walk the stack to retrieve it (slow). It will also call
 * {@link #startSendingOwnFrame()}}, so that the next time the method is called, the frame will be passed down and the
 * method does not need further de-optimizations.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link ReadCallerVariablesNode} is used similarly to access special variable storage, but for child nodes that only
 * require access to this storage ensures they receive an object that will not require node splitting to be accessed
 * efficiently. */
